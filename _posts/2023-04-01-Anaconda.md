Alright, here are the list of commands (olr actually options for the conda commands) that I have picked up along the way that I would like to keep track of. The idea is that I am keeping track of all the progress in learning for conda commands here.

## List of Commands

For Creating a new environment
``` bash
conda [options...] --no-default-packages #This is for creating an environment without any default packages installed
```
