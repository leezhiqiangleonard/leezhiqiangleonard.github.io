Alright, here are the list of commands (olr actually options for the conda commands) that I have picked up along the way that I would like to keep track of. The idea is that I am keeping track of all the progress in learning for conda commands here.

## List of Commands

For creating a new environment
``` bash
conda create --name [-n] myenv python=3.9 #Creating a new environment with python3.9 specified
```
``` bash
conda create --name [-n] myenv --clone base #Cloning a new environment from another environment
```
``` bash
conda [options...] --no-default-packages #This is for creating an environment without any default packages installed
# Example:
conda create -n myenv python=3.9 --no-default-packages
```
