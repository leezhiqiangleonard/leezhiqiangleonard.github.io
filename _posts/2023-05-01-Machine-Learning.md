Alright, here are the list of commands (olr actually options for the conda commands) that I have picked up along the way that I would like to keep track of. The idea is that I am keeping track of all the progress in learning for conda commands here.

# Machine Learning Concepts

## Supervised Learning: Introduction
Supervied Learning learns from data labeled with the "right answers".

## Supervised Learning: Regression

What is a regression task?
Regression predicts a number of infinitely many possible output values (e.g real numbers).

## Supervised Learning: Classification

What is a classification task?
Classification predicts a small finite limited set of categories (e.g 0,1,2).

## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction
Unsupervised Learning learns from unlabeled data. (Ask the algorithm to fogurw out all by yourself what's interesting, or what patterns or structures might be in this data)
