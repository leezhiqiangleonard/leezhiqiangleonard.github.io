Alright, here are the list of commands (olr actually options for the conda commands) that I have picked up along the way that I would like to keep track of. The idea is that I am keeping track of all the progress in learning for conda commands here.

# Machine Learning Concepts

## Terminologies
x: Input vairable/features
y: Output variable/target variables
m: Number of training variables
(x, y): Single training example
(x_{i}, y_{i}): i-th training example

## Supervised Learning: Introduction
Supervied Learning learns from data labeled with the "right answers".

## Supervised Learning: Regression

What is a regression task?
Regression predicts a number of infinitely many possible output values (e.g real numbers).

### Linear Regression
Trainin

## Supervised Learning: Classification

What is a classification task?
Classification predicts a small finite limited set of categories (e.g 0,1,2).

## Unsupervised Learning: Introduction
Unsupervised Learning learns from unlabeled data. (Ask the algorithm to fogurw out all by yourself what's interesting, or what patterns or structures might be in this data)

Formal Definition: Data only comes with inputs x, but nkt output labels y. Algorithm has to find structure in the data.

Examples of unsupervised learning: Clustering - group similar data points together, Anonaly detection - Find unusual data points, Dimensionality reductin - Compress data ising fewer numbers.
